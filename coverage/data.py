    """Manages collected coverage data, including file storage.

    This class is the public supported API to coverage.py's data.

    .. note::

        The file format is not documented or guaranteed.  It will change in
        the future, in possibly complicated ways.  Use this API to avoid
        disruption.

    There are three kinds of data that can be collected:

    * **lines**: the line numbers of source lines that were executed.
      These are always available.

    * **arcs**: pairs of source and destination line numbers for transitions
      between source lines.  These are only available if branch coverage was
      used.

    * **plugin names**: the module names of the plugin that handled each file
      in the data.


    To read a coverage.py data file, use :meth:`read_file`, or :meth:`read` if
    you have an already-opened file.  You can then access the line, arc, or
    plugin data with :meth:`lines`, :meth:`arcs`, or :meth:`plugin_name`.

    The :meth:`has_arcs` method indicates whether arc data is available.  You
    can get a list of the files in the data with :meth:`measured_files`.
    A summary of the line data is available from :meth:`line_counts`.  As with
    most Python containers, you can determine if there is any data at all by
    using this object as a boolean value.


    Most data files will be created by coverage.py itself, but you can use
    methods here to create data files if you like.  The :meth:`set_lines`,
    :meth:`set_arcs`, and :meth:`set_plugins` methods add data, in ways that
    are convenient for coverage.py.  To add a file without any measured data,
    use :meth:`touch_file`.

    You write to a named file with :meth:`write_file`, or to an already opened
    file with :meth:`write`.

    You can clear the data in memory with :meth:`erase`.  Two data collections
    can be combined by using :meth:`update` on one `CoverageData`, passing it
    the other.
